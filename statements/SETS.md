# SETS

In mathematics, a set is a well-defined collection of distinct objects, considered as an object in its own right. For example, the numbers 2, 4, and 6 are distinct objects when considered separately, but when they are considered collectively they form a single set of size three, written {2,4,6}. Sets are one of the most fundamental concepts in mathematics. Developed at the end of the 19th century, set theory is now a ubiquitous part of mathematics, and can be used as a foundation from which nearly all of mathematics can be derived.

Today we are going to use words from two awesome books, Frankenstein and The Picture of Dorian Gray, as sets. Could you answer the following questions?

* Get all the words you can find just in Frankenstein.
* Get all the words you can find just in The Picture of Dorian Gray.
* Get all the words you can find in both books sorted using descending ordering by word length.
* Get the words that appear at the same time in both books and not just the words that appears in just one of them.
* Get all the words you can find in Frankenstein and not in The Picture of Dorian Gray.
* Find the the book with more words.
* Get all the possible combinations of words you can find in Frankenstein and The Picture of Dorian Gray.
* Find the most repeated word you can read in both books.
