# Machine Learning

Machine learning is the subfield of computer science that, according to Arthur Samuel in 1959, gives "computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." Evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence, machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data â€“ such algorithms overcome following strictly static program instructions by making data-driven predictions or decisions, through building a model from sample inputs.

Apache Spark is a general purpose framework and it's not only focused on ML. Actually, Spark ML is just part of the Spark API. Based on this, we will implement an easy example using Spark ML just to review the basics.

Using an SVM algorithm create a program to identify when tweets are related to earthquakes or not.
